| [The Story Behind PyTorch and the Community Who Maintains It, with Soumith Chintala](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7dIyfimv1RnWsngy2SNl7e) |

**Tue, 24 May 2022**

There’s no need to bury the lead here. Soumith Chintala is the central figure in a major transition in the world of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. He works at Meta where he’s the manager of PyTorch, an open source machine learning framework that was recently transferred to the Linux Foundation. PyTorch enables ML engineers to deploy new AI models in minutes rather than weeks.

Soumith has been a community leader for the past decade, but he was a self-described introvert when he was growing up in Hyderabad. He is a researcher with over 52,000 citations and an h-index of 29 in Machine Learning, computer vision, and robotics, while focusing on high-risk research. From Marvel movies to memes, people such as Soumith are admired in modern culture. But this wasn’t the case in the 1990s when being a geek was still outside the norm.
